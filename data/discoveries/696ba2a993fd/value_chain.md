# Value Chain Segments

## 1. Soil Health & Regenerative Inputs
Biostimulants, biofertilisers, microbial consortia, compost/cover crop solutions, and amendments designed specifically for vineyards to improve soil structure, organic matter, and nutrient cycling while reducing synthetic inputs.

## 2. On-Farm Sensing & Monitoring
Hardware and integrated systems for in-field monitoring of soil moisture, soil carbon, plant health, microclimate, and pest/disease pressure, tailored to vine rows and perennial systems.

## 3. Decision Support & Farm Operating Systems
Software platforms and agronomic decision tools that help vineyard managers plan regenerative practices (cover crops, grazing, reduced tillage), optimise interventions, and track operational and financial performance.

## 4. MRV, Carbon & Ecosystem Services Platforms
Measurement, reporting, and verification tools for soil carbon, biodiversity, and other ecosystem services, enabling vineyards to access carbon credits, premiums, or sustainability-linked finance.

## 5. Robotics, Automation & Targeted Application
Autonomous or semi-autonomous machinery (e.g., electric tractors, under-vine weeding robots, precision sprayers) that reduce chemical use, soil compaction, and labour intensity while enabling regenerative practices at scale.

## 6. Regenerative Transition Services & Advisory Networks
Tech-enabled advisory, training, and service models that support vineyards in designing and implementing regenerative transitions, often combining agronomy expertise with digital tools.

## 7. Genetics, Rootstocks & Plant Material for Resilience
Breeding, clonal selection, and rootstock innovation aimed at drought tolerance, disease resistance, and compatibility with low-input, regenerative management in different terroirs.

## 8. Water Management & Climate Resilience
Irrigation optimisation, water reuse, and microclimate management solutions that help vineyards adapt to heat, drought, and extreme events while supporting regenerative soil and canopy practices.
