# Key Performance Indicators

**Regenerative Acreage Under Management / Influence**: >1,000 hectares within 3–5 years per platform or portfolio of projects
- Measures the real-world scale of regenerative practice adoption driven by the company or vineyard, beyond just pilots; core to climate, soil and biodiversity impact.

**Soil Health & Biodiversity Improvement Index**: Documented positive trend vs. baseline within 2–3 seasons (e.g., +10–20% improvement on composite index)
- Ensures that ‘regenerative’ is not just a label; tracks outcomes such as organic matter, microbial activity, ground cover, and biodiversity indicators, ideally verified by third parties or robust MRV.

**Water Use Efficiency in Vineyards**: ≥20% reduction in water use per unit of yield within 3–5 years
- Water stress is a critical risk in many wine regions; technologies and practices that maintain or improve yields with less water are both impact-positive and commercially valuable.

**Commercial Traction / Revenue Quality**: For early-stage tech: €500k–€2m annual recurring or repeat revenue within 3 years; for vineyards: positive operating cash flow within 3–5 years
- Ensures that impact solutions are commercially viable, with paying vineyards or stable offtake, not just grant- or pilot-dependent.

**Farmer / Vineyard Adoption and Retention**: ≥70% year-on-year retention of vineyard customers or partners; growing number of hectares per customer over time
- High retention and expansion indicate that solutions actually work in the field, are user-friendly, and create tangible value for growers.

**GHG Emissions Intensity and Sequestration**: Net reduction in emissions intensity per bottle or per hectare (e.g., ≥20% vs. baseline) and/or measurable carbon sequestration claims with credible MRV
- Aligns with climate-focused impact: reduced inputs, better soil carbon, and potential access to carbon markets or green premiums from buyers.
