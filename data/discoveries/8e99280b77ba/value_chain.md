# Value Chain Segments

## 1. Vineyard Robotics & Automation Platforms
Autonomous and semi-autonomous machines for vineyard operations such as weeding, mowing, under-vine management, canopy work, and harvesting, designed to reduce labor intensity and chemical herbicide use while enabling low- or no-till regenerative practices.

## 2. Precision Sensing & Monitoring (Vineyard-Specific)
In-field hardware and sensor networks (soil, plant, microclimate, canopy, disease and pest detection) tailored to vineyards, providing high-resolution data as the foundation for regenerative decision-making and reduced input intensity.

## 3. Decision-Support & Vineyard Management Software
Software platforms that integrate sensor data, weather, imagery, and operational records to guide irrigation, spraying, canopy management, and harvest decisions, explicitly enabling reduced chemical use, improved soil health, and better water efficiency.

## 4. Water & Irrigation Optimization Solutions
Vineyard-focused irrigation management tools, hardware, and analytics that optimize timing and volume of water use, improve drought resilience, and support regenerative water stewardship at block and vineyard scale.

## 5. Climate & Microclimate Resilience Tools
Technologies that help vineyards adapt to climate volatility—frost/heat mitigation, canopy microclimate management, site-specific risk modeling—supporting stable yields and quality under regenerative, lower-input regimes.

## 6. Biological Inputs for Vineyards
Biofertilizers, biostimulants, and biocontrol solutions with strong vineyard use cases or dedicated formulations, aimed at replacing or reducing synthetic fertilizers and pesticides while enhancing soil health and vine resilience.

## 7. Soil Health & Carbon / SOM Measurement in Vineyards
Tools and services for measuring soil organic matter, carbon stocks, and related soil health indicators in vineyards, enabling monitoring of regenerative outcomes and guiding management changes over time.

## 8. Regenerative Advisory, Integration & Enablement Services
Specialized service providers and integrators that help vineyards adopt regenerative practices and technologies—designing systems, integrating hardware/software, training staff, and translating tech capabilities into on-the-ground practice change.
