# Key Performance Indicators

**Reduction in Synthetic Chemical Inputs on Customer Vineyards**: ≥30–50% reduction within 2–3 years of adoption
- Directly captures the regenerative impact through lower herbicide, fungicide, and fertilizer use, especially relevant for robotics, DSS, and biologicals.

**Water-Use Efficiency Improvement**: ≥20–30% reduction in water use per hectare or per kg of grapes
- Core to climate resilience and regenerative practice; critical for irrigation optimization and microclimate tools, especially in drought-prone regions.

**Soil Health / Carbon Improvement**: Documented increase in soil organic matter (e.g., +0.1–0.3 percentage points per year) or verified carbon metrics on pilot blocks
- Links technology adoption to long-term soil regeneration and potential carbon value; particularly relevant for biologicals, robotics (reduced tillage), and DSS-driven practice changes.

**Commercial Traction in Vineyards**: ≥20–50 paying vineyard/winery customers or ≥500–1,000 ha under management, depending on stage
- Ensures the solution is not purely experimental; validates product–market fit in viticulture and the ability to scale beyond pilots.

**Unit Economics and Payback for Growers**: Payback period ≤3–5 years for hardware/robotics; clear ROI case within 1–2 seasons for software/biologicals
- Regenerative solutions must be economically compelling for growers; strong payback drives adoption and defensibility.

**Vineyard-Specific Focus and Adoption**: ≥50% of revenue or active hectares from vineyards/wineries, or a dedicated vineyard product line
- Ensures alignment with the thesis—companies should be meaningfully engaged in viticulture, not just generic agtech with a marginal wine use case.
