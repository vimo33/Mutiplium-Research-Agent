# Key Performance Indicators

**Demonstrated On-Farm Impact in Vineyards**: ≥10–20% improvement in at least one key metric (e.g., reduced synthetic inputs, improved water-use efficiency, yield stability, or soil organic matter) in independent or multi-season trials
- Ensures the solution delivers real, measurable agronomic and environmental benefits for vineyards, not just a software layer or marketing claim. This is central for regenerative credibility and long-term adoption.

**Vineyard Penetration and Retention**: ≥50–100 paying vineyard customers OR strong growth in a focused region (e.g., >30% YoY customer growth) with >85% annual logo retention
- Validates product–market fit in viticulture specifically, not generic ag. Retention indicates that solutions are embedded in operations, a key for defensibility and upsell.

**Revenue Quality and Growth**: Annual recurring or highly recurring revenue ≥€0.5–2m with >40–60% YoY growth for early-growth stage; clear path to gross margins >60% for software/MRV and >35–40% for hardware/inputs
- Screens for companies that have moved beyond pilots into repeatable, scalable business, while still at an entry point attractive for family-office tickets.

**Viticulture Focus and Depth**: ≥50% of revenue or pilots from vineyards/wineries, or a clear, defensible specialization in perennial crops with strong viticulture references
- Avoids generalist agtech where viticulture is an afterthought. Depth in vineyards (references, trials, integrations with winery workflows) increases adoption likelihood and pricing power.

**Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) Robustness**: Use of transparent methods (peer-reviewed models or accepted protocols) with auditable data trails; ability to export data to certification bodies or buyers
- MRV quality underpins both impact claims and future monetization (premiums, certifications, credits). Weak MRV is a red flag in a space where ‘regenerative’ can easily become greenwashing.

**Capital Efficiency and Payback for Growers**: For hardware/inputs: on-farm payback period ≤3–5 years under realistic vineyard economics; for software/MRV: clear ROI case (e.g., cost savings, risk reduction, or price premium) documented with customers
- Regenerative transitions are risky and cash-constrained. Solutions that pay back quickly for growers are more likely to scale and less exposed to subsidy cycles.

**MRV Robustness for Regenerative Outcomes**: Use of transparent methods (peer-reviewed models or accepted protocols) with auditable data trails and ability to export data to certification bodies or buyers
- MRV quality underpins both impact claims and future monetization (premiums, certifications, credits). Weak MRV is a red flag in a space where ‘regenerative’ can easily become greenwashing.

**Capital Efficiency and Grower Payback**: For hardware/inputs: on-farm payback period ≤3–5 years under realistic vineyard economics; for software/MRV: clear ROI case (e.g., cost savings, risk reduction, or price premium) documented with customers
- Regenerative transitions are risky and cash-constrained. Solutions that pay back quickly for growers are more likely to scale and less exposed to subsidy cycles.
