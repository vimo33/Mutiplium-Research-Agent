# Key Performance Indicators

**Evidence of Regenerative Impact (Soil/Biodiversity/Chemical Use)**: Clear data from trials or field pilots showing improvement on at least one key metric (e.g., +>10% SOM over baseline period, >20% reduction in synthetic inputs, or documented biodiversity gains)
- You explicitly exclude greenwashing and want evidence-based solutions. This KPI ensures companies can demonstrate, or are close to demonstrating, real regenerative outcomes in vineyards.

**Commercial Validation (Pilots and Early Revenue)**: At least 2–3 paid pilots with vineyards/wineries OR >€100k in annualized revenue from vineyard customers
- You accept pre-revenue companies but want validated products and services. Paid pilots or early revenue signal product–market fit and reduce technical/commercial risk.

**Vineyard-Specific Fit and Adoption Potential**: Demonstrated use in at least 2 distinct wine regions or appellations, with strong user feedback on ease of integration into existing operations
- Even globally scalable tech must fit vineyard workflows. This KPI ensures the solution works in real vineyard contexts and is not overly theoretical or region-locked.

**Scalability and Unit Economics**: Path to gross margin >60% (software/biologicals) or >35% (hardware/robotics) with a scalable go-to-market model
- You are open to all tech types, but capex-heavy, low-margin models are a concern. This KPI screens for economic scalability and investable business models.

**Scientific Credibility and R&D Depth**: Backed by agronomic/soil science expertise (internal or external) and at least one structured trial or collaboration with a reputable research or technical partner
- You want a good mix of scientific validation and field data. This KPI ensures a solid scientific foundation and ongoing evidence generation, not just anecdotal claims.

**Alignment with Reduced Chemical Dependency**: Clear mechanism and customer evidence that the solution enables reduction or substitution of synthetic fertilizers, herbicides, or pesticides without yield/quality loss
- You explicitly reject solutions that increase or maintain chemical dependency. This KPI makes that a hard filter and focuses on tools that enable more regenerative input regimes.
