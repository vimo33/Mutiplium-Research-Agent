# Value Chain Segments

## 1. Regenerative Vineyard Intelligence & Decision Support
Digital tools that help growers plan, monitor, and optimise regenerative practices in vineyards: farm OS platforms, decision-support systems integrating soil, climate, and plant data, tools for rotation/cover crop design, and scenario modelling for carbon, water, and biodiversity outcomes.

## 2. Soil Health, Carbon & Biological Inputs
Companies developing and supplying biologicals and inputs that enhance soil function and reduce synthetic chemicals: microbial and fungal consortia, bio-stimulants, biofertilisers, biochar, compost technologies, and amendments tailored to perennial crops and vineyards, with a clear soil-carbon and soil-health angle.

## 3. Water Management & Climate Resilience
Technologies and services that improve water-use efficiency and resilience to heat/drought: precision irrigation systems, soil moisture and microclimate sensing, water-stress analytics, deficit-irrigation optimisation, and tools for watershed-level planning relevant to wine regions.

## 4. Biodiversity & Landscape Regeneration
Solutions that design, implement, or monitor biodiversity in and around vineyards: cover cropping and inter-row vegetation systems, agroforestry and hedgerow design tools, habitat corridors, beneficial insect and pollinator support, and monitoring platforms that quantify biodiversity outcomes at parcel and landscape scale.

## 5. Reduced-Chemical Pest, Disease & Weed Management
Alternatives to synthetic pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides tailored to vineyards: biological control agents, mating disruption, novel formulations with lower toxicity, targeted application tools, and decision-support systems that minimise spray frequency and dosage while maintaining yield and quality.

## 6. MRV, Traceability & Environmental Accounting
Measurement, reporting, verification and traceability platforms that quantify regenerative outcomes and connect them to markets: soil carbon and GHG accounting, biodiversity and water metrics, plot-level traceability from vineyard to bottle, and integration with certifications, ESG reporting, and potential ecosystem-service monetisation.

## 7. Winery & Processing for Regenerative Systems
Technologies and practices in the winery that reinforce regenerative goals: low-energy and low-water processing, waste and by-product valorisation (e.g., pomace to high-value products), circular packaging, and systems that maintain the identity and story of regenerative grapes through vinification and bottling.

## 8. Regenerative Transition Services & Operating Platforms
Service and operating models that execute regenerative transitions on the ground: advisory and implementation services for vineyards, managed-regenerative vineyard platforms, shared machinery/robotics services, and bundled offerings that combine agronomy, finance, and tech to de-risk the transition for growers.

## 9. In-field Sensing, Drones & Monitoring
Hardware and software for monitoring vineyard conditions with minimal disturbance: drones, fixed sensors, satellite/imagery platforms, and edge devices that track soil moisture, canopy health, disease pressure, microclimate, and biodiversity indicators to inform regenerative decisions.

## 10. Robotics & Autonomous Vineyard Operations
Robots and autonomous machinery that replace or drastically reduce high-impact operations: electric or lightweight tractors, robotic weeders (mechanical/laser), autonomous mowing, targeted spraying for biologicals, and other systems that lower soil compaction, fuel use, and chemical inputs.

## 11. Biological Inputs & Soil Regeneration Technologies
Biostimulants, microbial consortia, cover-crop systems, composting solutions, and soil amendments designed to build soil organic matter, enhance nutrient cycling, and reduce reliance on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides in vineyards.

## 12. Water Management & Climate Resilience Solutions
Tools and services that improve water efficiency and resilience: precision irrigation, drought-resilient rootstocks/varieties, microcatchment and water-harvesting systems, decision-support for irrigation scheduling, and technologies that buffer vineyards against heat and hydric stress.

## 13. Biodiversity & Habitat Management in Vineyards
Solutions that design, implement, or manage biodiversity in and around vineyards: cover-crop design tools, agroforestry/hedgerow planning, habitat corridors, beneficial insect support, and services that integrate ecological design into vineyard layouts.

## 14. MRV, Traceability & Ecosystem Services Monetisation
Measurement, reporting and verification platforms, traceability tools, and data infrastructure that quantify regenerative outcomes (soil carbon, biodiversity, water, inputs) and connect them to certifications, premiums, or ecosystem service markets relevant to wine.

## 15. Regenerative Transition Services & Managed Vineyards
Service providers and operating platforms that help growers convert to regenerative practices: advisory, turnkey transition programs, managed vineyard models, and shared equipment/knowledge platforms that de-risk and operationalise change at farm level.

## 16. Winery, Processing & Circular Resource Solutions
Technologies and models at the winery/processing stage that reinforce regenerative outcomes: low-energy/low-water processing, waste-to-resource (e.g., grape marc valorisation), circular packaging/logistics, and systems that align downstream operations with regenerative branding and impact.
