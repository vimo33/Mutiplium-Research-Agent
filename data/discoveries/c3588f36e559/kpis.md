# Key Performance Indicators

**Soil Organic Carbon / Soil Health Improvement**: Clear pathway to ≥+0.2–0.5% SOC increase over 5 years OR robust proxy soil health metrics
- Soil carbon and broader soil health are core to regenerative viticulture; they underpin resilience, yield stability, and potential monetisation via ecosystem services. Even at early stage, the company should have a credible theory of change, measurement approach, or pilots showing directional improvement.

**Water Use Efficiency & Resilience**: ≥20–30% reduction in water use per hectare or per kg of grapes in pilot settings, OR demonstrable improvement in drought resilience / reduced irrigation dependency
- Water is a major constraint in key wine regions. Solutions should materially improve water productivity or climate resilience, not just monitor without actionable impact.

**Chemical Input Reduction**: ≥30–50% reduction in synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers in pilots without yield/quality collapse
- Reducing synthetic inputs is central to regenerative practice and a key differentiator vs conventional viticulture. Early-stage companies should show or plausibly model a step-change, not marginal gains.

**Biodiversity Impact in/around Vineyards**: Evidence of increased species richness/abundance (e.g., cover crops, insect/avian diversity) or structural diversity (hedgerows, agroforestry) within 3–5 years
- Biodiversity is both an outcome and a driver of regenerative resilience. Companies should either directly enhance habitat/functional diversity or enable growers to measure and manage it.

**Scalability Across Wine Regions**: Clear path to deployment in ≥2–3 major wine regions (e.g., EU + US or EU + Southern Hemisphere) within 5–7 years
- Given your global focus and ticket size, solutions should be adaptable beyond a single niche terroir or micro-market, even if initial pilots are local.

**Commercial & Adoption Readiness**: Initial revenue, paid pilots, or strong LOIs with vineyards/wineries within 12–24 months of investment
- Even for very early-stage, there must be a line of sight to real adoption by growers/wineries, not just lab-stage tech. This anchors the impact in real-world practice change.
