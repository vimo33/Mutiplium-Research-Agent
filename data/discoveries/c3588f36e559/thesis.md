Regenerative viticulture sits at the intersection of climate risk, ecological degradation, and the economic fragility of winegrowers in key regions worldwide. As climate volatility, water stress, and soil degradation intensify in major wine regions (France, Italy, Spain, US, Chile, Australia, South Africa), growers and wineries are under mounting pressure—from regulators, buyers, and consumers—to transition to practices that restore soil function, sequester carbon, enhance biodiversity, and reduce chemical inputs. Yet the transition is complex, knowledge-intensive, and often perceived as risky at the farm level. This creates a significant need for new technologies, services, and business models that de‑risk and operationalize regenerative practices in vineyards and along the wine value chain.

This project focuses on mapping and identifying **investable companies**, with a bias toward **tech-led solutions**, that materially advance four core outcome areas in and around vineyards: (1) soil health and carbon sequestration, (2) water use and climate resilience, (3) biodiversity enhancement, and (4) reduction or replacement of synthetic chemical inputs. We will look across the full regenerative wine system—from in-field sensing, biological inputs, and decision-support tools, to MRV (measurement, reporting, verification), supply-chain traceability, and winery/processing innovations that reinforce regenerative practices upstream. While the core emphasis is on wine, we will include a small (~5%) set of adjacent perennial/ag-tech plays where there is a clear, defensible path to application in viticulture.

Given FO Pilot’s flexibility on stage and check size, the opportunity lies in building a **pipeline of early and emerging leaders**: from experimental/R&D-stage ventures piloting in vineyards, to more mature platforms already scaling across regions. The thesis is that regenerative viticulture will move from niche to necessity, and that value will accrue to companies that (i) make regenerative transitions economically attractive and operationally simple for growers and wineries, (ii) can credibly quantify and verify ecological outcomes, and (iii) are architected to scale across diverse terroirs and regulatory contexts. This landscape will prioritize companies with measurable impact on the four core outcomes, clear adoption pathways with growers/wineries, and potential to become critical infrastructure or category leaders in regenerative wine.
