# KPI Framework

**Confidence Scale:** 0.0 = anecdotal claim only; 0.5 = single trusted source or pilot data; 1.0 = peer-reviewed, third-party validated, and observed across multiple vineyards. Report `confidence_0to1` using this scale.

**Evidence Expectations:** Each KPI should include a quantified data point when available (percentage change, hectares covered, tCO₂e, etc.). Reference the KPI name exactly in `kpi_alignment`.

## 1. Soil Health Technologies
- **Soil Carbon Sequestration** (priority 0.90, Impact) – Capture SOC increases (% or tCO₂e/ha) verified by lab testing, academic partners, or certification audits.
- **Microbial Biodiversity Enhancement** (priority 0.85, Impact) – Report measurable uplift in microbial diversity indices or enzyme activity with before/after comparisons.
- **Tier 1 Validation Evidence** (priority 0.80, Evidence) – Cite peer-reviewed research, government grants, or recognised certifications (e.g., Regenerative Organic Certified) confirming soil outcomes.

## 2. Precision Irrigation Systems
- **Water Use Efficiency Improvement** (priority 0.88, Impact) – Quantify % reduction in irrigation volume per hectare or litres saved versus baseline.
- **Synthetic Input Reduction** (priority 0.75, Impact) – Document fertiliser/pesticide reductions enabled by precision fertigation or moisture sensing.
- **Tier 2 Verification Evidence** (priority 0.70, Evidence) – Highlight vineyard case studies, grower testimonials, or utility/agency reports demonstrating real-world savings.

## 3. Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
- **Pesticide Reduction** (priority 0.90, Impact) – State the % reduction in chemical applications, citing season-over-season or block-level data.
- **Biodiversity Support** (priority 0.80, Impact) – Provide evidence of beneficial insect counts, native species return, or biodiversity scoring improvements.
- **Tier 1 Validation Evidence** (priority 0.80, Evidence) – Reference academic trials, extension service studies, or regulatory approvals supporting IPM performance.

## 4. Canopy Management Solutions
- **Yield Consistency** (priority 0.70, Operational) – Capture variance reduction or yield stability metrics across climate-stressed seasons.
- **Disease Reduction** (priority 0.75, Impact) – Quantify lower incidence of mildew/botrytis or reduced fungicide sprays tied to canopy interventions.
- **Tier 2 Verification Evidence** (priority 0.70, Evidence) – Cite grower case studies, cooperative pilot data, or viticulture research institute reports.

## 5. Carbon MRV & Traceability Platforms
- **Carbon Sequestration Verification** (priority 0.85, Impact) – Provide measured tCO₂e/ha, permanence assessments, or third-party verified certificates.
- **Traceability Enhancement** (priority 0.80, Impact) – Describe supply-chain transparency, QR traceability adoption, or certification integrations linking vineyard practices to finished wine.
- **Tier 1 Validation Evidence** (priority 0.80, Evidence) – Reference MRV audit partners, ISO/GHG protocol compliance, or peer-reviewed methodology papers.
