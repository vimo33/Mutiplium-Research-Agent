What you\u2019re hoping to explore or achieve with this research on regenerative viticulture / winetech (e.g., sourcing investments, landscaping the space, validating a thesis, etc.)?\n2. Whether you\u2019re primarily interested in technology companies (software, hardware, biotech), operational models (regenerative vineyard operators), or the broader ecosystem (services, marketplaces, carbon, etc.)?\n\nOnce I understand your main objective and scope, we can narrow down sectors, stages, and geographies."
