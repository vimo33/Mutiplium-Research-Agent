What is the primary goal of this research for you:  \n   - Identifying potential investment targets?  \n   - Mapping the landscape/value chain?  \n   - Validating an investment thesis you already have?  \n   - Or something else (e.g., impact measurement, portfolio support)?\n\n2. Within \u201cregenerative viticulture,\u201d are you more interested in:\n   - On-vineyard practices and technologies (soil, water, inputs, biodiversity, sensors, robotics, etc.)  \n   - Supply-chain / winery / downstream (traceability, certification, carbon accounting, premiumization of regenerative wines)  \n   - Or the full stack from vineyard to bottle?\n\nOnce I understand this, I can start shaping the research structure around your needs."

      "content": "[THESIS_START]\nRegenerative viticulture sits at the intersection of climate adaptation, premium agricultural products, and tightening environmental regulation. Vineyards are high-value, perennial systems that are acutely exposed to climate stress (drought, heat, extreme events) and regulatory pressure on chemicals and water use. At the same time, wine is one of the few agricultural products where provenance, story, and production methods can directly translate into price premiums and long-term brand equity. This combination makes viticulture a natural early adopter for regenerative practices\u2014provided there are robust, evidence-based tools to manage risk, prove outcomes, and integrate practices into daily operations.\n\nThe investable opportunity for FO XX lies in the enabling \u201cinfrastructure\u201d for regenerative viticulture rather than in consumer brands. This includes soil and ecosystem intelligence platforms, biological and regenerative agronomy solutions, precision vineyard operations (including robotics and smart implements), and robust MRV, certification, and traceability systems that connect practices in the vineyard to quality and value in the bottle. Winery and supply-chain analytics that link regenerative practices to measurable quality, cost, and environmental outcomes further strengthen the business case, while lighter-touch outcome-based finance and insurance tools can unlock adoption by reducing risk for growers and wineries.\n\nWe see the most attractive risk/return profile in early-growth companies (late Seed to Series B) with: (1) strong agronomic and scientific grounding, (2) demonstrable environmental impact (soil health, reduced inputs, water and climate resilience) and economic impact for growers, and (3) scalable, software- or data-leveraged business models, sometimes bundled with hardware or biological products. FO XX can target globally, with emphasis on evidence-based markets where field trials, policy frameworks, and standards (e.g., in Europe, North America, and select Southern Hemisphere regions) provide validation and defensibility. The core thesis is that as regenerative viticulture moves from niche to norm, the winners will be the platforms and tools that make this transition measurable, operationally viable, and financially attractive at scale.\n[THESIS_END]\n\nThis is a first-pass thesis based on what you\u2019ve shared.\n\nTo refine it toward FO XX\u2019s style:\n\n1. Would you like the thesis to be **shorter and punchier** (e.g., 1 tight paragraph + 3 bullet points), or is this level of detail about right?\n2. Should we explicitly mention **impact tolerance for slightly lower IRR** if outcomes are very strong, or keep the language strictly \u201cmarket-rate, impact as a must-have filter\u201d?"
