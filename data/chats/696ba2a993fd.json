The core opportunity lies in backing pre-seed and seed-stage companies that directly improve soil health, reduce synthetic inputs, and enhance climate resilience in vineyards, while creating measurable environmental outcomes that align with an impact-focused family office. Viticulture is uniquely suited for regenerative transformation: it is high value per hectare, highly exposed to climate risk, and deeply brand- and terroir-driven, meaning growers and wine brands have both economic and reputational incentives to differentiate on sustainability and resilience.\n\nMarket dynamics are increasingly favourable. Climate change is already disrupting leading wine regions through heat, drought, disease pressure, and extreme weather, pushing growers to seek solutions that protect yield and quality while preserving long-term soil function. At the same time, downstream buyers (wineries, retailers, and premium brands) are under pressure to demonstrate credible climate and biodiversity action, creating demand for vineyards that can prove regenerative practices and outcomes. This opens space for new solution providers in areas such as soil health inputs, sensing and monitoring, decision-support tools, and MRV (measurement, reporting, verification) for carbon and ecosystem services. By focusing on pre-seed and seed tickets in the \u20ac250k\u2013\u20ac1m range, with selective exposure to slightly more established players as proof points, the family office can build a diversified portfolio of enabling technologies and models that benefit from both regulatory tailwinds and shifting consumer preferences, while anchoring returns in tangible, on-farm impact.\n[THESIS_END]\n\nWould you like this thesis to lean more toward:\n- climate/carbon and MRV,\n- or more toward practical agronomy and yield/quality resilience for growers?"
