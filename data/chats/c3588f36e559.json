Here\u2019s a first pass you can react to:\n\n[THESIS_START]\nThis research project will map and surface early-stage, high-impact opportunities across the global regenerative viticulture value chain, with emphasis on major wine regions (France, Italy, Spain, US, Chile, Australia, South Africa). The core focus is on companies and initiatives that directly improve soil health and carbon sequestration, water use and resilience, biodiversity in and around vineyards, and reduction of synthetic chemical inputs, while being on a credible path to investability in the near term.\n\nThe landscape will deliberately include a spectrum of models: tech-first solutions (e.g., sensing, decision-support, biological inputs, robotics, MRV and traceability tools), operational and service platforms (e.g., regenerative transition services for vineyards, managed regenerative vineyards, ecosystem service monetisation), and enabling infrastructure across the wine value chain that reinforces regenerative practices. Priority will be given to very early / experimental ventures (R&D, pilots, small startups) where \u20ac500k\u20132m tickets can be catalytic, with flexibility to consider adjacent models or stages if they are strategically important for the regenerative wine system.\n[THESIS_END]\n\nDoes this capture your intent, or is anything missing (e.g., social impact, premiumization/brand angle, carbon markets, or alignment with specific standards like ROA, Demeter, etc.)?\n\nNext, to refine how we *evaluate* companies in this map:\n\n1. Are you open to **non-wine crops** if they\u2019re highly relevant to vineyards (e.g., perennials, orchards, mixed agroforestry tools) and could be applied to viticulture, or should we stay strictly wine-focused?\n\n2. Are there any **hard deal-breakers** you already know (e.g., synthetic chemistry-only plays, pure marketing/labeling with no measurable impact, heavy dependence on unproven voluntary carbon credits, etc.)?\n\nOnce I know that, I\u2019ll start drafting a first set of KPIs tailored to your impact and investment lens."

Here\u2019s a first version you can react to:\n\n[THESIS_START]\nRegenerative viticulture sits at the intersection of climate risk, ecological degradation, and the economic fragility of winegrowers in key regions worldwide. As climate volatility, water stress, and soil degradation intensify in major wine regions (France, Italy, Spain, US, Chile, Australia, South Africa), growers and wineries are under mounting pressure\u2014from regulators, buyers, and consumers\u2014to transition to practices that restore soil function, sequester carbon, enhance biodiversity, and reduce chemical inputs. Yet the transition is complex, knowledge-intensive, and often perceived as risky at the farm level. This creates a significant need for new technologies, services, and business models that de\u2011risk and operationalize regenerative practices in vineyards and along the wine value chain.\n\nThis project focuses on mapping and identifying **investable companies**, with a bias toward **tech-led solutions**, that materially advance four core outcome areas in and around vineyards: (1) soil health and carbon sequestration, (2) water use and climate resilience, (3) biodiversity enhancement, and (4) reduction or replacement of synthetic chemical inputs. We will look across the full regenerative wine system\u2014from in-field sensing, biological inputs, and decision-support tools, to MRV (measurement, reporting, verification), supply-chain traceability, and winery/processing innovations that reinforce regenerative practices upstream. While the core emphasis is on wine, we will include a small (~5%) set of adjacent perennial/ag-tech plays where there is a clear, defensible path to application in viticulture.\n\nGiven FO Pilot\u2019s flexibility on stage and check size, the opportunity lies in building a **pipeline of early and emerging leaders**: from experimental/R&D-stage ventures piloting in vineyards, to more mature platforms already scaling across regions. The thesis is that regenerative viticulture will move from niche to necessity, and that value will accrue to companies that (i) make regenerative transitions economically attractive and operationally simple for growers and wineries, (ii) can credibly quantify and verify ecological outcomes, and (iii) are architected to scale across diverse terroirs and regulatory contexts. This landscape will prioritize companies with measurable impact on the four core outcomes, clear adoption pathways with growers/wineries, and potential to become critical infrastructure or category leaders in regenerative wine.\n[THESIS_END]\n\nWould you like this thesis to:\n- Put **more emphasis on MRV/traceability and data infrastructure**, or  \n- More emphasis on **biologicals / inputs / in-field solutions**,  \nor is this current balance about right for you?"
