- **Exclusion Keywords:** broadacre crops, generic horticulture without grape case studies, greenhouse-only IPM.
- **Anti-Patterns:** Exclude mosquito/vector control vendors or orchard-only programmes.
- **Geographic Targets:**
  - EU: Andermatt Biocontrol (CH), Bioplanet (IT).
  - LATAM: BioGrow (CL), Agroprecisión (AR vineyards).
  - ANZ: Zonda Beneficials (NZ), Aerobotics viticulture scouting (ZA/AU).

## 4. Canopy Management Solutions

- **Keywords:** canopy analytics, phenotyping, robotic pruners, multispectral imaging, vigor maps, yield consistency, climate adaptation.
- **Targets:** 10 companies illustrating canopy or disease improvements (e.g., % reduction in mildew, yield stability), with examples from both Old and New World regions.
- **Anchors:** VineView (US/FR), Green Atlas (AU), Bloomfield Robotics (US/IT), Vitibot (FR).
- **Exclusion Keywords:** generic drone photography with no canopy analytics, cereal crop phenotyping, greenhouse robotics.
- **Anti-Patterns:** Avoid indoor vertical farming robotics or orchard-only thinning tools.

  - EU: Wall-Ye (FR), Naïo Technologies (FR vineyard robotics).
  - LATAM: Instacrop (CL), Inversiones Agrourbana (precision canopy pilots).
  - ANZ: SmartMachine (NZ), Green Atlas (AU reference vineyards).

## 5. Carbon MRV & Traceability Platforms
- **Focus:** WINE-SPECIFIC platforms that combine (a) vineyard carbon measurement/verification AND (b) supply-chain traceability (QR codes, bottle-level tracking, blockchain provenance). Must serve wine industry specifically.
- **Keywords:** wine carbon traceability, bottle tracking, vineyard carbon footprint, wine sustainability platform, carbon MRV viticulture, wine supply chain transparency, regenerative wine certification, wine blockchain, wine sustainability labels.
