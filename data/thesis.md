# Investment Thesis: Regenerative Viticulture Technology

## Core Belief
The global wine industry is shifting toward regenerative viticulture to address climate resilience, consumer demand for sustainable production, and emerging carbon-credit revenue streams. Vineyard-focused technology platforms that measurably reduce chemical inputs, fossil fuel usage, water consumption, and soil disturbance will capture a 15–25% share of vineyard technology spend by 2030.

## Investment Focus
- B2B solutions serving vineyard operations across the full regenerative value chain: soil health intelligence, precision irrigation, integrated pest management, canopy automation, and carbon MRV/traceability.
- Preference for technologies designed specifically for viticulture (not generic broad-acre ag solutions) with demonstrable field deployments.
- Prioritise offerings that integrate hardware + software + analytics to deliver measurable KPI outcomes tied to regenerative principles.

## Geographic Coverage
- Require at least 50% non-US companies.
- Priority regions: Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Portugal; Australia/New Zealand; South Africa; Chile/Argentina; high-altitude LATAM; UK and Scandinavia as emerging cool-climate regions.
- Capture regulatory and certification nuances (e.g., EU Green Deal, Regenerative Organic Certified) when relevant.

## Anchor Signals & Exemplars
- Soil health intelligence: Biome Makers (ES), Trace Genomics (US), Vivent Biosignals (CH).
- Precision irrigation: SupPlant (IL), WiseConn (CL), Naïo / Vitibot robotics (FR).
- Integrated pest management: Semios (CA), Trapview (SI), UAV-IQ (US).
- Canopy automation/analytics: VineView (US/FR), Green Atlas (AU), Bloomfield Robotics (US/IT).
- Carbon MRV & traceability: Regrow Ag (US), Soil Capital (BE), Circular Wine (IT).

## Evidence Requirements
- Cite primary company materials plus at least one independent source (industry press, academic research, accelerator portfolio) per company.
- Highlight quantified outcomes wherever available (e.g., % reduction in pesticides, SOC increase, water savings).
- Map findings to the KPI framework and flag maturity indicators (pilot vs. commercial rollout).
- Confidence scoring (0–1): vineyard specificity (0.4), independent verification (0.3), deployment evidence (0.3).

## Exclusions
- Consumer wine apps, e-commerce marketplaces, loyalty programs.
- Generic precision agriculture platforms without vineyard deployments.
- Marketing/PR agencies or services unrelated to regenerative outcomes.

## Output Expectations
- Minimum of five companies per value-chain segment (25+ total) with structured fields: `company_name`, `website`, `country`, `region_state`, `segment`, `subsegment`, `value_chain_stage`, `regenerative_link`, `kpi_alignment`, `notes`, `confidence_0to1`, `sources` (3–5 URLs).
- Note any data gaps or additional research recommended for analyst follow-up.

## Preferred Source Types
- Official company websites, press releases, product datasheets.
- Industry publications: Wine Business Monthly, Wines & Vines, Meininger’s Wine Business International.
- Academic journals: OENO One, American Journal of Enology and Viticulture.
- Conference proceedings: Wine Industry Technology Symposium, Unified Wine & Grape Symposium.
- Certification bodies: Regenerative Organic Certified, Demeter Biodynamic, EU organic registries.
- VC/accelerator portfolios: Better Ventures, Astanor Ventures, AgFunder, WineTech Network.
