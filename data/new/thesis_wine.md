# Investment Thesis: Wine Value Chain — KPI-Aligned Opportunities

## Core Belief
The wine industry is undergoing a multi-year shift toward data-driven quality, efficiency, and sustainability across the **entire value chain** (viticulture → vinification → packaging → logistics → retail/DTC → aftermarket). Solutions that **directly move stage-specific KPIs**—yield, quality, OEE, TPO/DO control, OTIF, conversion/retention, carbon/water intensity, and traceability coverage—will compound advantages for producers and distributors. We believe KPI-proven platforms purpose-built for wine will capture a **disproportionate share (15–25%) of tech spend** across mid-market and premium segments over the next cycle.

## Investment Focus
- **B2B platforms** mapped to value-chain stages with **measurable KPI lift** (see table below), including precision viticulture, cellar automation/analytics, packaging QA, temperature-controlled logistics telemetry, retail/DTC revenue engines, and sustainability/traceability stacks.
- Preference for **wine-specific** technology (vs. generic ag/CPG) with **documented winery/vineyard deployments** and integrations to category tooling (LIMS, cellar SCADA, WMS/TMS, POS/e‑commerce, QR/NFC).
- Favor **systems that integrate HW + SW + analytics** and expose API/ETL to unify **KPI dashboards** across vineyard, cellar, and commercial operations.
- Clear linkage from **feature → KPI → financial impact** (COGS/case, gross margin by channel, churn, write‑offs, working capital).

## Geographic Coverage
- At least **50% non‑US** dealflow.
- Priority: **EU** (ES, FR, IT, DE, PT), **ANZ**, **South Africa**, **LATAM** (CL, AR), plus **UK/Scandinavia** for cool‑climate growth.
- Consider **GI/appellation** and certification context (AOC/DOC/DOP, organic/biodynamic/regen, SWNZ/HVE) when sizing adoption and pricing power.

## Anchor Signals & Exemplars (by value-chain stage)
- **Viticulture:** NDVI/IoT stacks reducing **disease incidence** (<2–5%), improving **yield/ha** and lowering **chemical intensity**; irrigation telemetry improving **m³/tonne** and labor productivity.  
- **Vinification:** In‑tank sensing + fermentation control with **>98% success rate**, higher **L/t yield**, and lower **VA**; cellar **OEE↑** and **COGS/case↓**.  
- **Packaging:** Lines with **OEE > 70%**, **TPO ≤ 1.0 mg/L**, reduced defect ppm, lightweight/recycled glass adoption.  
- **Logistics:** Telemetry lowering **temperature excursions <1%**, **OTIF > 95%**, **breakage <0.5%**, and landed cost improvements.  
- **Retail/DTC:** Velocity u/s/w growth, **DTC conversion 2–5%+**, **club retention ≥ 75–85%**, improved gross margin mix.  
- **Marketing/Branding:** Ratings/awards driving measurable **velocity uplift**, **SoV** and engagement up, **tourism→purchase** conversion.  
- **Consumption & Aftermarket:** Higher **repurchase**, reduced cellar complaints; authenticated resale indices for fine wines.  
- **Cross‑cutting:** **Carbon, water, energy intensity** trending down; **traceability coverage ≥ 90%** of SKUs with QR/NFC/ledger.

## Opportunity Map (aligned to KPIs)
- **1) Viticulture** — Precision sensing, IPM decision support, irrigation optimization, canopy robotics; targets: **yield/ha↑**, **disease↓**, **water intensity↓**, **labor productivity↑**, **canopy variability CV↓**.  
- **2) Vinification** — Fermentation analytics/control, inline NIR, mass‑balance & QA; targets: **L/t yield↑**, **fermentation success >98%**, **VA↓**, **cellar OEE↑**, **COGS/case↓**.  
- **3) Packaging** — Filler/closure oxygen control, vision QA, predictive maintenance; targets: **OEE↑**, **TPO↓**, **defect ppm↓**, **GHG/9L↓**, **bottle weight↓ / %PCR↑**.  
- **4) Distribution & Logistics** — Temp/humidity loggers + TMS/WMS; targets: **OTIF↑**, **temp excursions↓**, **landed cost/case↓**, **turns↑**, **breakage↓**.  
- **5) Retail & Sales** — Demand sensing, assortment/price optimization, DTC funnel tooling; targets: **velocity↑**, **DTC conversion↑**, **club retention↑**, **gross margin by channel↑**.  
- **6) Marketing & Branding** — Ratings orchestration, SoV tracking, experiential CRM; targets: **rating‑uplift→velocity↑**, **SoV/engagement↑**, **tourism→purchase↑**, **CAC:LTV≥3:1**.  
- **7) Consumption** — Post‑purchase feedback & QC telemetry; targets: **repurchase↑**, **review distribution↑**, **complaints/10k↓**.  
- **8) Recycling & Aftermarket** — Cork/glass recovery, provenance; targets: **glass recovery↑**, **cork volumes↑**, **resale index↑**, **counterfeit rate↓**.  
- **Cross‑cutting** — Carbon/water/energy & **traceability coverage** tracked per SKU/vintage.

## Exclusions
- Generic ag or CPG tooling **without** vineyard/winery deployments or KPI proof.  
- Pure consulting/marketing services lacking measurable KPI linkage.  
- Carbon/MRV platforms **without** bottle/lot‑level traceability relevant to wine.  
- Broad‑acre crop solutions with **no varietal/appellation context** or integrations.

  `segment`, `subsegment`, `product`, `value_driver`, `kpi_alignment`, `evidence_summary`, `confidence_0to1`, `sources` (3–5 URLs).
- Flag **data gaps** and propose validation steps (pilot design, dataset requests).
