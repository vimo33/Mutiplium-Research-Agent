# Missing Companies Diagnosis

## 3D2cut
- **Relevant:** True
- **Segment:** Canopy
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Reason for Miss:** Company website is vinevisionsystem.com, not 3d2cut.com - URL mismatch caused search to miss primary source. Search results show 3D2cut is primarily a research dataset rather than a commercial product, though vinevisionsystem.com shows it as an AR pruning solution. Lack of named clients or quantified yield/disease reduction results in public search results.
- **Recommendation:** SHOULD INVESTIGATE FURTHER - This is a legitimate vineyard technology (AI-powered AR glasses for pruning optimization) with direct impact claims on yield and disease reduction. The company claims 'optimise vine pruning, increase yield, reduce diseases' which directly addresses core KPIs. However, evidence level is Medium because: (1) No case studies or named clients visible in search results, (2) Appears to be early-stage/research-to-commercial transition (dataset published 2023, product website exists but minimal commercial validation), (3) URL confusion between research dataset (3d2cut) and commercial entity (vinevisionsystem.com). The technology has clear vineyard focus and potential for direct impact on yield and IPM, but needs verification of commercial deployments and quantified results. Likely missed due to: limited online commercial presence, recent market entry, and primary web presence under different domain name.

## Aerobotics
- **Relevant:** True
- **Segment:** Canopy
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Reason for Miss:** Search results failed to return Aerobotics-specific content despite URL pointing to their grape case study. The generic search returned academic papers and competitor content (VinEye, Integrape) but missed the actual Aerobotics Viljoen Farms testimonial. This suggests Aerobotics may have weak SEO presence or the case study page lacks sufficient indexable content about vineyard-specific results.
- **Recommendation:** SHOULD BE SELECTED. Aerobotics is a well-established precision agriculture company with documented vineyard clients (Viljoen Farms case study URL provided). They use UAV/drone technology for aerial imaging and crop monitoring, which directly impacts yield optimization and resource management in vineyards. The miss occurred due to search engine limitations rather than company irrelevance. Recommend: (1) Direct site scraping of aerobotics.com/success-stories/ section, (2) Search for 'Aerobotics wine' or 'Aerobotics grapes South Africa' specifically, (3) Check their client list/testimonials page directly. Their technology fits the Canopy Management/Disease Detection segment and likely has quantified impact data in their actual case studies.

## Altr
- **Relevant:** False
- **Segment:** Other
- **Evidence Level:** Low
- **Reason for Miss:** Search results contain no information about 'Altr' company - only generic vineyard technology articles. The URL 'altrfltr.com' suggests a filtration product, but zero search results mention this company, its products, or any vineyard/wine applications. Without any company-specific information in results, cannot determine relevance.
- **Recommendation:** INCONCLUSIVE - Requires direct company research. The search query returned only general vineyard technology literature with no mention of Altr. Need to: 1) Visit altrfltr.com directly to understand product offering, 2) Search for 'Altr filtration wine' or 'altrfltr vineyard', 3) Check if this is a water filtration company that might serve irrigation needs. The '.com/altrfltr' URL pattern suggests either a typo or a filtration product, but current search provides zero evidence to assess against selection criteria.

## BioScout
- **Relevant:** True
- **Segment:** IPM
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Reason for Miss:** Likely missed due to generic 'agriculture' positioning in company description rather than explicit 'vineyard' or 'wine' keywords. The company's own website may emphasize broader agricultural applications, while vineyard-specific evidence appears in third-party sources (AFR article, La WineTech profile).
- **Recommendation:** SHOULD HAVE BEEN SELECTED. BioScout meets all three criteria: (1) Vineyard/Winery Focus - explicitly mentioned in AFR title 'protect farms, vineyards from disease' and featured on La WineTech (wine technology platform); (2) Direct Impact - automated airborne disease detection directly affects yield protection, reduces chemical spraying (carbon/biodiversity impact), and provides real-time disease risk assessment for strategic intervention timing; (3) Evidence - Has case study documented by Tiller Design, finalist in Financial Review AI Awards (Sustainability category), and specific wine industry recognition via La WineTech platform. The technology uses patented biological sensors with AI for fungal disease tracking, providing quantifiable value through reduced unnecessary spraying and improved disease management timing. This is a clear IPM solution with demonstrated vineyard application and recognition in wine tech circles.

## Burro
- **Relevant:** True
- **Segment:** Other
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Reason for Miss:** Labor automation doesn't directly map to the four core KPI categories (yield, water, carbon, biodiversity). The robots primarily address labor efficiency and material transport, which are operational improvements rather than direct environmental/agronomic KPIs.
- **Recommendation:** BORDERLINE CASE - Should be included with caveats. While Burro has clear vineyard presence (named client: Best's Wines with Ben Thomson; table grape harvest deployments in California), the impact is indirect. Labor efficiency ENABLES better practices (more consistent scouting, faster material movement, reduced fuel from fewer tractor trips), but the company doesn't quantify yield improvements or carbon reductions. The autonomous robots transport harvested grapes and materials, and can be equipped with cameras for disease detection (per Farmers Weekly NZ article), suggesting potential IPM applications. However, without case studies showing 'X% yield increase' or 'Y tons CO2 saved', it falls short of the strict 'Evidence' bar. If the selection criteria expand to include 'operational efficiency that enables sustainability', Burro qualifies. For strict interpretation focused on direct KPI impact with quantified results, it should be excluded unless disease-detection results emerge.

## Chouette
- **Relevant:** True
- **Segment:** IPM
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Reason for Miss:** Search results provide minimal concrete detail about Chouette's specific technology, quantified impacts, or named vineyard clients. The snippets mention 'precision viticulture solution' and 'reducing agrochemicals' but lack the depth of case studies or specific KPI metrics that would make it an obvious selection.
- **Recommendation:** SHOULD have been selected with deeper investigation. Evidence: (1) Clear vineyard/wine focus - founded as 'winetech' specifically for winegrowers (SITEVI source). (2) Direct impact potential - Kubota partnership explicitly mentions 'reducing agrochemicals' which directly affects IPM and sustainability KPIs. (3) Evidence bar: Medium - has named partnerships (Kubota, presence at SITEVI wine trade show) and operational since 2015, but search results lack quantified case studies or specific client results. The miss likely occurred because snippets don't reveal the technology mechanism (computer vision per company name 'Chouette' = owl, suggesting surveillance/monitoring), and no yield/water/carbon numbers appear in these particular search results. Recommend: Direct website review and request for case studies to confirm quantified impact data before final inclusion.

## CO2 Winery
- **Relevant:** False
- **Segment:** MRV
- **Evidence Level:** Low
- **Reason for Miss:** Company name 'CO2 Winery' appears to be a winery business, not a technology provider. Search results return academic case studies ABOUT wineries measuring their carbon footprints, not evidence of CO2 Winery being a technology/service provider FOR the wine industry. The URL https://co2winery.com/ likely belongs to an actual winery operation, not an agtech company.
- **Recommendation:** Not relevant for inclusion. This appears to be a winery (wine producer) rather than a technology/service provider serving vineyards. The search results discuss carbon footprint studies of wineries in general, not a company called 'CO2 Winery' providing technology solutions. If the company were a carbon measurement/MRV provider for vineyards, we would expect to see: (1) evidence of services offered to other wineries, (2) technology platform descriptions, (3) client testimonials or case studies where they helped other operations. None of this appears in the results. The company name may be misleading - it could be a winery that emphasizes sustainability in its branding rather than a B2B service provider.

## Coravin
- **Relevant:** False
- **Segment:** Other
- **Evidence Level:** Low
- **Reason for Miss:** Consumer wine preservation product, not vineyard/agricultural technology. No impact on viticulture operations, yield, water usage, carbon footprint, or biodiversity. This is a B2C retail product for wine consumption/serving, not a B2B agricultural solution.
- **Recommendation:** CORRECTLY EXCLUDED. Coravin manufactures wine preservation systems for consumers, restaurants, and wine retailers to pour wine without removing the cork. While it operates in the 'wine' space, it has zero relevance to vineyard operations or grape growing. It addresses wine wastage at the point of consumption, not agricultural KPIs. The search results confirm this is a consumer product design/merchandising company with no connection to viticulture, precision agriculture, or sustainability metrics in grape production. This company should NOT be selected under any circumstances as it fails Criterion #1 (vineyard/winery operational focus) entirely.

## Croptide
- **Relevant:** True
- **Segment:** Irrigation
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Reason for Miss:** Company name 'Croptide' lacks obvious vineyard/wine keywords that would trigger in broad agricultural technology searches. The search results show clear wine/vineyard focus, but initial screening might have filtered it out as generic 'fruit grower' technology since early mentions bundle 'fruit and wine growers' together.
- **Recommendation:** SHOULD HAVE BEEN SELECTED. Croptide explicitly serves wine growers with water measurement sensors and recently launched 'alora', an AI vineyard assistant. Evidence includes: (1) $1M funding announcement specifically mentioning wine growers, (2) Product launch coverage in wine industry publication (Rural News Group), (3) Direct vineyard application with voice-activated AI assistant. Evidence level is 'Medium' rather than 'High' because while there are named product launches and industry coverage, the search results don't reveal specific winery clients or quantified water savings/yield impacts. However, the company clearly meets the vineyard focus criterion and directly impacts water KPI. Recommend inclusion with note to seek case studies with quantified results during deeper research phase.

## Cropsy Technologies
- **Relevant:** True
- **Segment:** Canopy
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Reason for Miss:** Company name 'Cropsy' lacks obvious vineyard/wine keywords that would trigger typical search filters. General agritech terminology ('crop vision', 'AI', 'computer vision') could blend with broader agriculture technology without specific viticulture context being immediately apparent in company name or generic descriptions.
- **Recommendation:** SHOULD HAVE BEEN SELECTED. This is a clear false negative. Cropsy Technologies has:

1. **Vineyard/Winery Focus**: Explicitly focused on viticulture with named vineyard clients (Pressley Vineyards) and partnerships in wine regions (Marlborough NZ).

2. **Direct Impact**: AI-powered crop vision system mounted on tractors that scans individual vines for pruning quality optimization - directly impacts yield management and labor efficiency (core KPIs).

3. **Strong Evidence**: 
   - Named client case study (Pressley Vineyards)
   - Multiple case studies referenced (Marlborough NZ, NZGCP)
   - Described as 'trusted partner among growers' with technology 'firmly embedded into routine vineyard management'
   - University of Auckland feature article
   - Real-time AI and computer vision with quantifiable outcomes

Likely missed due to: (1) Generic company name without wine/vineyard identifiers, (2) Broad 'agritech' categorization that could apply to any crop, (3) Technology descriptors (AI, computer vision) being universal agriculture terms. Search strategy should include broader agritech monitoring with secondary vineyard validation checks.

## Exxact Robotics (TRAXX)
- **Relevant:** True
- **Segment:** IPM
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Reason for Miss:** Likely missed due to focus on hardware/robotics platform rather than specific impact metrics. Search may have prioritized software/data companies over autonomous equipment manufacturers. Company primarily markets as 'robotic platform' rather than emphasizing quantified sustainability outcomes (water reduction, chemical reduction %, yield impact).
- **Recommendation:** SHOULD BE INCLUDED. Exxact Robotics (TRAXX) is clearly vineyard-specific with named client testimonials (Stéphane Dubreuil, 100+ hours of use) and documented applications. The autonomous vineyard robot performs multiple tasks: soil monitoring, weed control, spraying, and fertilization. The UV-C treatment capability mentioned for ICARO X4 enables 'significant reduction in chemical use' which directly impacts IPM and potentially biodiversity KPIs. While the search results lack precise quantified metrics (e.g., '30% chemical reduction'), the company has: (1) clear vineyard focus, (2) real client usage, (3) documented feedback from growers, and (4) claims about chemical reduction. Evidence level is 'Medium' rather than 'High' due to lack of specific case study numbers in these snippets, but the company meets inclusion criteria. The hydrogen-fueled concept also suggests carbon reduction potential. This is a legitimate miss that should be corrected - it's a production-ready vineyard automation solution with client validation.

## Hiphen
- **Relevant:** True
- **Segment:** Canopy
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Reason for Miss:** Search results show vineyard relevance but lack specific case study details or quantified impact metrics. The company appears in a generic article title about grape harvesting with mention of Champagne video content, but no concrete KPI data (yield improvements, water savings, etc.) is visible in the snippets. The URL structure suggests they have vineyard-specific content, but the search didn't surface quantified results or named clients that would meet the 'High' evidence bar.
- **Recommendation:** SHOULD INVESTIGATE FURTHER - The company clearly works in vineyards (specific mention of Champagne grape harvest transformation). However, the search results don't reveal: (1) What specific technology they provide (phenotyping? imaging? sensors?), (2) Quantified impacts on core KPIs, or (3) Named client testimonials. The direct URL reference to 'hiphen-plant.com/...grape-harvesting...' and mention of video content suggests substantial vineyard engagement. Recommend: (a) Visit their main solutions pages to identify specific technology offerings, (b) Search for 'Hiphen phenotyping vineyard' or 'Hiphen plant imaging case study' to find technical details, (c) Check if they have a clients/results section with quantified outcomes. This company was likely missed due to lack of keyword-rich snippets containing KPI data, despite probable relevance.

## Lumo
- **Relevant:** True
- **Segment:** Irrigation
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Reason for Miss:** This company should NOT have been missed - it has exceptionally strong vineyard credentials and evidence
- **Recommendation:** PRIORITY ADDITION - Lumo has multiple named vineyard clients (Wente, Woodhawk Vineyards), explicit case studies focused on wine operations, trials in Napa vineyards covered by industry press, and is used by 5 of the 10 largest winegrape growers in the US. The company has quantified impacts on labor reduction, fuel savings, carbon footprint, and water management - directly addressing multiple core KPIs. This is a clear oversight in the original selection process and should be added immediately to the database.

## Packamama
- **Relevant:** False
- **Segment:** Other
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Reason for Miss:** Packamama is a wine packaging/bottling company, not a vineyard technology provider. They manufacture flat, recyclable wine bottles to reduce carbon footprint in wine distribution and packaging. They have zero impact on vineyard operations, grape growing, yield, water use, or biodiversity. Their sustainability impact is entirely downstream in the supply chain (packaging/transport), not in agricultural production.
- **Recommendation:** CORRECTLY EXCLUDED - This company does not meet selection criteria #2 (Direct Impact on core vineyard KPIs). While they serve the wine industry and have strong evidence of environmental impact, their technology addresses packaging/logistics carbon emissions, not vineyard management. They would belong in a 'Wine Supply Chain Sustainability' category if one existed, but are not relevant to precision viticulture or vineyard operations research.

## Rootwave
- **Relevant:** True
- **Segment:** IPM
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Reason for Miss:** Vineyard application mentioned only in academic review, not prominently featured in company marketing or search snippets. Primary search results focus on general agricultural weed control without vineyard-specific case studies or quantified wine industry impacts.
- **Recommendation:** SHOULD BE INCLUDED - Electric weed control directly impacts core KPIs (reduces chemical inputs, improves soil/water/biodiversity). Cambridge academic review explicitly mentions 'adapted its technology for vineyards and orchards.' However, company needs deeper investigation to find vineyard-specific case studies or named wine industry clients. Evidence bar is 'Medium' because vineyard adaptation is confirmed but specific wine industry results/clients are not visible in these search results. Follow-up needed: contact company directly for vineyard case studies, search for wine industry trade publications mentioning Rootwave, or look for European vineyard adoption (UK-based company likely has EU wine customers).

## SAGA Robotics (Thorvald)
- **Relevant:** True
- **Segment:** IPM
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Reason for Miss:** Likely missed due to niche technology focus (UV-C robotics) that may not appear in standard 'precision viticulture' or 'vineyard management' searches. Company may be categorized primarily as 'agricultural robotics' rather than specifically 'vineyard technology' in databases.
- **Recommendation:** SHOULD HAVE BEEN SELECTED. Strong evidence of vineyard focus with named clients (Willamette Valley Vineyards in Oregon, Bien Nacido in California), quantified deployment (1,300+ acres treated in California vineyards), and clear KPI impact. The Thorvald platform provides autonomous UV-C light treatment for powdery mildew control, directly impacting: (1) Chemical reduction - replacing fungicides/organic sulphur inputs, (2) Sustainability metrics - chemical-free IPM approach reduces environmental impact, (3) Cost efficiency - stated as 'lower cost' than traditional methods, (4) Labor efficiency - autonomous nighttime operation. Has case studies, multiple named vineyard clients, and specific acreage metrics. This is a clear miss that should be added to the master list under IPM/Disease Management segment.

## Tastry
- **Relevant:** False
- **Segment:** Other
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Reason for Miss:** Company operates in wine production/consumer-facing technology, not vineyard operations. Focus is on AI-driven wine tasting, blending recommendations, and consumer preferences - downstream from agricultural production. Does not directly impact core vineyard KPIs (yield, water use, carbon footprint, biodiversity).
- **Recommendation:** Correctly excluded. Tastry is a wine industry technology company focused on product development, blending optimization, and consumer recommendation systems. While they serve wineries and have case studies (e.g., 'Tastry Rescues an Entire Shale Canyon Vintage'), their impact is on wine quality, consumer satisfaction (45% increase mentioned), and sales/marketing - not on vineyard agricultural practices. Their 'smoke impact analysis' program is about finished wine quality assessment, not vineyard management. This is analogous to including a packaging optimization company - wine-related but not viticulture-focused. The search correctly filtered this out as it doesn't address irrigation, soil health, pest management, or other in-field agricultural operations.

## UV Boosting
- **Relevant:** True
- **Segment:** IPM
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Reason for Miss:** Likely missed due to non-standard technology category (UV-C light treatment) that may not have appeared in typical agtech/precision agriculture keyword searches. The technology bridges plant health/IPM and frost protection, making it harder to categorize in standard searches focused on soil sensors, irrigation systems, or chemical IPM solutions.
- **Recommendation:** SHOULD HAVE BEEN SELECTED. Strong evidence across multiple criteria: (1) Clear vineyard/winery focus with named client (Veenow Vineyard, UK) and BBC news coverage; (2) Direct impact on multiple KPIs including pest/disease management (fungal disease prevention, 'reduces pesticide reliance'), frost risk reduction (50% risk reduction claimed), and crop quality (better quality grapes); (3) High evidence level with concrete case study, quantified results (50% frost risk reduction), European initiative backing, and mainstream media validation. This is a valid precision agriculture technology that uses UV-C flash technology to stimulate plant defense mechanisms. The miss likely occurred because searches focused on conventional IPM categories (sensors, spraying systems, biologicals) rather than novel light-based stimulation technologies. Recommend adding UV-C/light technology keywords to future IPM searches.

## VEGEA
- **Relevant:** False
- **Segment:** Other
- **Evidence Level:** Low
- **Reason for Miss:** VEGEA is a biomaterials company that converts wine industry waste (grape marc, stems, skins) into sustainable materials for fashion/cosmetics industries - not an agricultural technology for vineyard management. Search results show general wine sustainability studies but no connection to VEGEA specifically. The company operates downstream of wine production (waste valorization) rather than affecting vineyard KPIs.
- **Recommendation:** Correctly excluded. VEGEA is a circular economy/waste management company serving the wine industry, not a precision agriculture or vineyard technology provider. Does not impact yield, water efficiency, carbon reduction, or biodiversity in vineyards. Their impact is in waste reduction and alternative materials, which falls outside the scope of vineyard management technologies affecting core agricultural KPIs.

## Vinventions
- **Relevant:** False
- **Segment:** Other
- **Evidence Level:** Low
- **Reason for Miss:** Vinventions focuses on wine closures/bottle preservation technology, not vineyard operations or viticulture. They manufacture specialized wine corks (Nomacorc) with controlled oxygen permeability for post-bottling wine preservation. This is a winery/packaging technology, not a vineyard sustainability solution affecting yield, water use, carbon footprint, or biodiversity in the growing phase.
- **Recommendation:** Correctly excluded. While Vinventions operates in the wine industry and has sustainability initiatives (reducing wine spoilage/waste), they do not provide technology that impacts vineyard-level KPIs. Their solutions affect post-harvest wine quality and preservation, not agricultural practices. The case study mentioned relates to cellar practices and bottling performance, not vineyard management. This company should remain outside the scope of a vineyard sustainability technology audit.

## W Platform (CO2Box)
- **Relevant:** True
- **Segment:** MRV
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Reason for Miss:** Highly niche technology focused on carbon capture/reuse rather than carbon measurement. Search terms may not have captured 'CO2 capture' or 'fermentation CO2 recycling' as distinct from general carbon reduction. The CO2Box product name is obscure and doesn't appear prominently in search results.
- **Recommendation:** SHOULD HAVE BEEN SELECTED. Clear vineyard/winery focus with named technology (CO2Box) capturing fermentation CO2 for reuse. Wine Business article provides specific evidence of deployment in Bordeaux wineries. Direct carbon impact (capturing and recycling CO2 emissions). While not traditional MRV, this is a tangible carbon reduction technology with documented winery applications. Search terms should include: 'fermentation CO2 capture', 'wine carbon capture technology', 'CO2 recycling winery'. The miss likely occurred due to: (1) focus on CO2 reuse rather than measurement/monitoring, (2) CO2Box not being used as primary search term, (3) relatively new/niche technology with limited English-language case study documentation beyond initial press coverage.
