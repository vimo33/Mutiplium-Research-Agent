  "thesis": "Regenerative viticulture sits at the intersection of climate resilience, premium agricultural value chains, and shifting consumer preferences toward environmentally responsible products. Vineyards are structurally exposed to climate risk (heat, drought, frost, disease pressure) while also being high-margin, brand-sensitive systems where growers and wineries can justify investments in quality, sustainability, and resilience. This makes wine a natural \u201cbeachhead crop\u201d for regenerative technologies that improve soil health, reduce synthetic inputs, optimize water, and stabilize yields under climate stress.\n\nWithin this context, there is a compelling opportunity to back enabling technologies that make regenerative viticulture economically and operationally viable at scale. Priority domains include: (1) vineyard robotics and automation that reduce dependence on herbicides and intensive manual labor through under-vine management, weeding, mowing, and precision operations; (2) sensing, data, and decision-support platforms that provide granular insight into soil, plant health, disease risk, irrigation needs, and carbon/soil organic matter, enabling lower-input, evidence-based management; (3) water and climate resilience solutions that optimize irrigation, mitigate drought and frost risk, and manage canopy microclimates; and (4) biological inputs (biofertilizers, biostimulants, biocontrols) that replace or significantly reduce synthetic fertilizers and pesticides while supporting vine and soil health. We will include both companies that explicitly position themselves as regenerative/organic/biodynamic and those whose core impact clearly enables regenerative outcomes, even if not branded as such.\n\nFrom an investment standpoint, the focus is on early growth-stage companies (from advanced pilots to early commercialization) in Europe and key New World regions (US, Chile, Australia, South Africa), with flexibility to include globally relevant outliers. The thesis targets solutions that are either vineyard/wine-specific or have a demonstrably strong vineyard segment, with clear pathways to measurable impact: reduced chemical usage, improved soil structure and biodiversity, enhanced water-use efficiency, and increased resilience to climate volatility. Over time, successful platforms in this space may expand into adjacent perennial crops, but the immediate opportunity is to identify and back category leaders in regenerative winetech who can prove both robust unit economics for growers and credible, quantifiable environmental benefits for impact-focused capital.",
