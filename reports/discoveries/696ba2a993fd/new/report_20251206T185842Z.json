  "sector": "Winetech - Regenerative Viticulture",
  "thesis": "This research project targets early-stage, on-farm technologies and inputs that enable a scalable transition to regenerative viticulture globally. The core opportunity lies in backing pre-seed and seed-stage companies that directly improve soil health, reduce synthetic inputs, and enhance climate resilience in vineyards, while creating measurable environmental outcomes that align with an impact-focused family office. Viticulture is uniquely suited for regenerative transformation: it is high value per hectare, highly exposed to climate risk, and deeply brand- and terroir-driven, meaning growers and wine brands have both economic and reputational incentives to differentiate on sustainability and resilience.\n\nMarket dynamics are increasingly favourable. Climate change is already disrupting leading wine regions through heat, drought, disease pressure, and extreme weather, pushing growers to seek solutions that protect yield and quality while preserving long-term soil function. At the same time, downstream buyers (wineries, retailers, and premium brands) are under pressure to demonstrate credible climate and biodiversity action, creating demand for vineyards that can prove regenerative practices and outcomes. This opens space for new solution providers in areas such as soil health inputs, sensing and monitoring, decision-support tools, and MRV (measurement, reporting, verification) for carbon and ecosystem services. By focusing on pre-seed and seed tickets in the \u20ac250k\u2013\u20ac1m range, with selective exposure to slightly more established players as proof points, the family office can build a diversified portfolio of enabling technologies and models that benefit from both regulatory tailwinds and shifting consumer preferences, while anchoring returns in tangible, on-farm impact.",

      "raw": "# Value Chain Segments\n\n## 1. Soil Health & Regenerative Inputs\nBiostimulants, biofertilisers, microbial consortia, compost/cover crop solutions, and amendments designed specifically for vineyards to improve soil structure, organic matter, and nutrient cycling while reducing synthetic inputs.\n\n## 2. On-Farm Sensing & Monitoring\nHardware and integrated systems for in-field monitoring of soil moisture, soil carbon, plant health, microclimate, and pest/disease pressure, tailored to vine rows and perennial systems.\n\n## 3. Decision Support & Farm Operating Systems\nSoftware platforms and agronomic decision tools that help vineyard managers plan regenerative practices (cover crops, grazing, reduced tillage), optimise interventions, and track operational and financial performance.\n\n## 4. MRV, Carbon & Ecosystem Services Platforms\nMeasurement, reporting, and verification tools for soil carbon, biodiversity, and other ecosystem services, enabling vineyards to access carbon credits, premiums, or sustainability-linked finance.\n\n## 5. Robotics, Automation & Targeted Application\nAutonomous or semi-autonomous machinery (e.g., electric tractors, under-vine weeding robots, precision sprayers) that reduce chemical use, soil compaction, and labour intensity while enabling regenerative practices at scale.\n\n## 6. Regenerative Transition Services & Advisory Networks\nTech-enabled advisory, training, and service models that support vineyards in designing and implementing regenerative transitions, often combining agronomy expertise with digital tools.\n\n## 7. Genetics, Rootstocks & Plant Material for Resilience\nBreeding, clonal selection, and rootstock innovation aimed at drought tolerance, disease resistance, and compatibility with low-input, regenerative management in different terroirs.\n\n## 8. Water Management & Climate Resilience\nIrrigation optimisation, water reuse, and microclimate management solutions that help vineyards adapt to heat, drought, and extreme events while supporting regenerative soil and canopy practices.\n\n"
