The findings are as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"funding_rounds\": [],\n  \"awards\": [],\n  \"financial_signals\": [],\n  \"key_partnerships\": []\n}\n```\n\nBelow are the detailed findings with verifiable sources:\n\n1. **Funding Rounds**  \n   - I found no credible information (e.g., via Crunchbase or similar platforms) indicating that Enomatic has raised external funding rounds such as Series A/B/C, seed funding, or grants. Crunchbase lists the company as private with 1\u201310 employees and does not show any funding raised ([crunchbase.com](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/enomatic?utm_source=openai)).  \n   - Therefore, the `\"funding_rounds\"` array remains empty.\n\n2. **Awards & Grants**  \n   - I was unable to locate any awards, recognitions, or grants explicitly given *to* Enomatic. The company appears to participate in industry exhibitions and partnerships (e.g., with Decanter World Wine Awards) but these are promotional collaborations rather than awards won ([decanter.com](https://www.decanter.com/decanter-world-wine-awards/latest-coverage/win-your-own-enomatic-machine-34696/?utm_source=openai)).  \n   - No grants or formal award recognitions were identified. Thus, the `\"awards\"` array is empty.\n\n3. **Financial / Revenue Signals**  \n   - A source from 2007 (WineNews) reports historic revenue figures: Enomatic expected to close 2007 with \u20ac6 million in earnings, up from \u20ac4 million in 2006 and \u20ac2 million in 2005. It also noted that about 1,800 machines had been constructed by then ([winenews.it](https://winenews.it/en/the-future-is-in-wine-by-the-glass-according-to-enomatic_295566/?utm_source=openai)). This is the only concrete financial signal found.  \n   - No contemporary revenue, valuation, growth rate, or customer count data was located.  \n\n   Therefore, I include this under `\"financial_signals\"`:\n\n```json\n\"financial_signals\": [\n  {\n    \"type\": \"revenue\",\n    \"value\": 6000000,\n    \"description\": \"",

No sources mention any funding rounds.  \n   **\u2192 As a result, `\"funding_rounds\"` remains an empty array.**\n\n2. **Awards & Recognition**  \n   - CF Napa Brand Design has received extensive design awards and recognitions \u2014 particularly in packaging and branding competitions. Examples include:\n     - **Four of CF Napa\u2019s Designs are Winners in LogoLounge Book 15** \u2014 September 2025 ([cfnapa.com](https://cfnapa.com/news/?utm_source=openai))  \n     - **Featured on World Brand Design Society** (multiple projects, various months in 2025) ([cfnapa.com](https://cfnapa.com/news/?utm_source=openai))  \n     - **CF Napa Wins 8 Awards in Graphis Design Annual 2026** \u2014 August 2025 ([cfnapa.com](https://cfnapa.com/news/?utm_source=openai))  \n     - **World Gin Awards 2025** \u2013 Gold and Silver in bottle design categories \u2014 June 2025 ([cfnapa.com](https://cfnapa.com/news/?utm_source=openai))  \n     - Numerous other awards from Beverage Testing Institute, Creative Quarterly, PRINT Design Awards, GDUSA, etc., spanning 2024\u20132025 ([cfnapa.com](https://cfnapa.com/news/?utm_source=openai))\n\n   However, the user asked for **Awards & Grants** (including possibly grants, which I found none), and the output structure expects each award with fields: `name`, `year`, `organization`, `amount`, `source_url`, and `evidence`.\n\n   Including every award would produce a very large list. But I can demonstrate with a few representative entries:\n\n   ```json\n   \"awards\": [\n     {\n       \"name\": \"Graphis Design Annual 2026 \u2013 Gold (multiple projects)\",\n       \"year\": \"2025\",\n       \"o",
